A voice feature to transcribe voice to text that has been integrated with agent 0 (agent framework).
using grok as the llm provider for the model whisper-large-v3 . this model is multilingual and can be used to transcribe voice to text in different languages.
I have also added the voice feature to the ui , check the webui folder for the voice functionality.
